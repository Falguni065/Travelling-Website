    <h2>Narikel Jinjira Restaurant</h2>

    <h4>Description </h4>


    Music Eco Resort, luckily, has a restaurant (Narikel Jinjira) down where all the people
    get off the ship. This is convenient because this restaurant has a really good
    atmosphere and even better food. So for those who don’t feel like eating fish
    coated in sand, this is a good place to start off the journey before you head out
    to the resort. The chefs of Music Eco Resort are brilliant and whether you’re at the
    restaurant or the resort, great food is guaranteed. And the décor, in wooden panels and
    chairs, has a homely feel to it. Basically, it’s all good.
