    <p>Bandarban has been the most beautiful tourist destination of Bangladesh in recent years.
        Nature has adorned this region with its magnificent and splendid green ornaments.
        Beauty is scattered everywhere of Bandarban in magnanimous mood.
        One will find the virgin beauty of Bandarban on every step he or she advances.
        Nature is extravagant here. Behind the name of Bandarban there is an overwhelming story.
        Long time ago this district was a great natural habitat for monkeys and it was crisscrossed by numerous canals (jhiri).
        Monkeys used to collect fruits from forests on the other side of the canal and cross it.
        After eating and collection of fruits, they returned in the same way as a group.
        When they crossed canals it looked like a dam from a distance.
        It caught the sight of local Marma community and they termed it as Magci.
        Here Mag means monkeys and Ci means dam.
        Gradually it has been transformed in the local dialect Bandarbon.
        With the passage of time it has undergone a phonetic change and now it is Bandarban.</p>
