    <h2>Woondal King Kebab</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    It is the place which is well known to each and everyone in Sylhet who love to eat outside.
    Situated at Barutkhana Road, it has always served its customers flavorsome and delectable Indian
    cuisine. This is the perfect place for having lunch or dinner in Sylhet. The ambiance is not
    extraordinary but the food is out of the world. As I am from Sylhet, I have been to this place
    uncountable times. I must say, some of their dishes are so tasty and scrumptious that it’s going
    to beat any of the Indian restaurants in the country. They have the best Hydrabadi biriyani in town
    which is worth of BDT210+ only. The rice of the biriyani is very flavorful and the meat is tender
    and soft. They have some curry options which go really well with their prominent garlic naan, butter
    naan and aloo paratha. In terms of curries, they offer paneer butter masala, chicken vorta, beef
    shatkora, beef achari, mutton masala, mutton korai are the winners. Paneer butter masala is a
    vegetarian dish where paneer cubes are cooked in a special curry sauce. It is so mouth-watering
    that every time I end up licking my fingers dipped in that sauce. Chicken vorta translates to
    smashed chicken, but it’s actually thin pieces of chicken cooked with spicy masala and served with
    eggs. Beef Shatkora is a famous dish all over Sylhet which is a beef curry cooked with a vegetable
    called “Shatkora”. Mutton masala, mutton korai, beef achari, all these dishes are appetizing.
    All the curry dishes are priced between BDT180-300. Most of the dishes are 1:3. So, it’s better
    to go along with two people. It’s not going to cost more than BDT1500 for three people in Woondal.

    <h2>Hot Spot</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    Located in the heart of Sylhet Zindabazaar, this place usually serves Italian and Mexican cuisine.
    They serve Mexican dishes like burritos, quesadillas, cheese steak and Italian dishes like pasta,
    pizza. It is not popular among foodies because of not selling traditional food items and being
    expensive. But they have one stand out dish which deserves plenty of appreciation. The name of
    the dish is “Philadelphia Cheese Steak”. It’s not an ordinary steak dish and could be found only
    at a few restaurants in the country. The steak is stuffed with philadelphia cheese and tastes
    amazing. Each bite of the steak tastes heavenly.

    They sell tea all day long which is refreshing and dense. It’s a proper Bengali restaurant and a
    meal costs only BDT250-400 per person. The ambiance of this restaurant is not appropriate for families. This place is always overcrowded and sometimes people have to hold others chairs so that they can sit after the person already sitting finishes the meal. Cleanliness and hygiene are the biggest concerns for the restaurant. They also have some other branches in Sreemongol, Moulovibazaar, but the one in Sylhet is always the favorite of many people. If you are craving from some authentic delicious Bengali food at a very reasonable price, then this is an ideal place.
