    <h3>Royal Sundarban</h3>
    <br>

    Royal Sunderban Wild Resort in Jharkhali Island in the best location closest to
    the forest core area to spend an ideal tine amidst nature for a couple of days.
    It has cottages for accommodation with the most modern amenities with 35 guests.
    The balconies in the cottage allow a clear view of the water body and the garden.
    The Royal Sunderban Wild Resort is an unique destination just beside a large sweet
    water lake which is the home for migratory birds during winter months.
    Tourists can reach Sunderbans on fixed departure dates or any day as per the choice of tourists.

    The Sunderbans support one of the largest populations of Royal Bengal Tiger.
    These man-eaters who have often been the harbingers of death in these parts also at
    the same time give the place its fundamental character of existence. However recent years have witnessed
    sharp decline in their numbers. In August 2004 there were in total approximately 256 individuals in Sunderban
    which in the current year (2013) have been estimated to be only 103. The predominant reasons behind this drastic
    downfall are poachers and an acute scarcity of food. However recently another significant reason behind this decline
    has been brought to notice by the research conducted by scientists at the Cardiff University, UK. According to them
    the absence of enough genetic variation among tigers is the real culprit.
